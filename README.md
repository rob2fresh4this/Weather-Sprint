# Weather App Prototype

## Overview
This project is a prototype for a weather application. The goal is to provide users with a streamlined experience for accessing and saving weather information.

---

## Features
### Core Functionalities:
1. **Search Weather by Location**  
   - Users can search for and retrieve weather information for a specific city.

2. **Favorite Cities**  
   - Add searched cities to a favorites list for quick access.

3. **Weather Information Display**  
   - Current weather at the time of the search.
   - General 5-day weather forecast.
   - Max and min temperatures for the current day.

4. **Data Persistence**  
   - All data will persist when the user closes and reopens the browser.

---

## Design Requirements
- **Desktop-Only Build**: The app will be optimized for desktop screens.
- **Custom Design**: The app must be visually appealing with a designed user interface.

---

## Notes
- You can use this [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/) for weather data.
- Refer to **Some Ideas** for design inspiration or additional features.

---

## Development Guidelines
- **Persistence**: Use a suitable method (e.g., `localStorage`) to ensure data remains after the browser is closed.
- **Design**: Focus on creating a clean and user-friendly layout.
- **API Integration**: Utilize the OpenWeatherMap API effectively to fetch and display accurate weather data.
